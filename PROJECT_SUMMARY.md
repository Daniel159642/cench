- **Secure IPC communication** between main and renderer processes

### AI Integration
- **OpenAI GPT-4 integration** for natural language processing
- **Context-aware conversation** with recent message history
- **Safe code generation** with validation before execution
- **Automatic command execution** (optional setting)

### DaVinci Resolve Integration
- **Python API wrapper** for DaVinci Resolve communication
- **Connection testing** and status monitoring
- **Code safety checks** before execution
- **Sandboxed execution environment**

### User Interface
- **Modern dark theme** with black styling (as requested)
- **Draggable overlay window** with smooth interactions
- **Real-time status indicators** for connections
- **Settings panel** for configuration
- **Responsive design** with professional styling

### Database & Storage
- **SQLite database** for command storage and history
- **Command examples** with natural language mappings
- **Chat history persistence** between sessions
- **Settings management** with file-based storage
