# 🎬 After Effects + Cench AI Real-Time Workflow

## 🚀 **Quick Start Guide**

### **Step 1: Set Up After Effects**
1. **Open Adobe After Effects 2025**
2. **Create a new project** (File → New → New Project)
3. **Create a new composition** (Composition → New Composition)
   - Set resolution (e.g., 1920x1080)
   - Set duration (e.g., 10 seconds)
   - Set frame rate (e.g., 30 fps)

### **Step 2: Test the Connection**
1. **Run the test script**: `python3 test_realtime_aftereffects.py`
2. **Follow the prompts** to see real-time changes
3. **Watch After Effects** as commands execute

### **Step 3: Use Cench AI for Real-Time Control**
Once connected, you can use natural language commands like:

## 🎯 **Real-Time Commands You Can Try**

### **Basic Layer Creation**
- "Create a text layer saying 'Hello World'"
- "Add a solid red layer"
- "Create a new composition called 'Main Comp'"

### **Layer Manipulation**
- "Move the text to the center"
- "Scale the layer to 200%"
- "Rotate the layer 45 degrees"
- "Set the opacity to 50%"

### **Effects and Animation**
- "Apply a blur effect"
- "Add a drop shadow"
- "Make the text wiggle"
- "Add a keyframe at 2 seconds"

### **Text Effects**
- "Change text color to blue"
- "Make the text bigger"
- "Add a stroke outline"
- "Center align the text"

## 🔄 **Real-Time Workflow Tips**

### **Keep Both Apps Visible**
- **After Effects** on one side
- **Cench AI** on the other side
- See changes happen instantly!

### **Use Clear Commands**
- **Good**: "Make the text red and bigger"
- **Better**: "Change text color to red and scale to 150%"

### **Check Feedback**
- Look at After Effects console for confirmation
- Watch the composition for visual changes
- Use undo (Cmd+Z) if needed

## 🎨 **Sample Workflow Example**

1. **Start**: "Create a new composition called 'My Animation'"
2. **Add Content**: "Create a text layer saying 'Welcome'"
3. **Style**: "Make the text blue and center it"
4. **Animate**: "Add a wiggle expression to the position"
5. **Enhance**: "Apply a drop shadow effect"
6. **Refine**: "Scale the text to 120%"

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### **If Commands Don't Work**
- Make sure After Effects is the active application
- Check that a composition is open
- Verify the connection in Cench AI settings

### **If Changes Don't Appear**
- Check After Effects console for errors
- Make sure the composition is visible
- Try refreshing the view (Cmd+Shift+U)

### **Performance Tips**
- Keep compositions simple for testing
- Use lower resolutions for faster feedback
- Save your project frequently

## 🎬 **Advanced Workflows**

### **Animation Sequences**
1. "Create a text layer"
2. "Add position keyframes at 0s and 5s"
3. "Set first keyframe to left side"
4. "Set second keyframe to right side"
5. "Add ease-in-out to the animation"

### **Effect Stacks**
1. "Apply a blur effect"
2. "Set blur amount to 10"
3. "Add a glow effect on top"
4. "Adjust glow intensity to 50%"

### **Layer Management**
1. "Create 3 solid layers"
2. "Arrange them in a row"
3. "Add different colors to each"
4. "Group them together"

## 🔗 **Integration with Cench AI App**

Once the app is fully working:
1. **Open Cench AI overlay**
2. **Type natural language commands**
3. **See real-time changes in After Effects**
4. **Build complex animations step by step**
