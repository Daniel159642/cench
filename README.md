Cench AI runs as a floating overlay application, similar to how Cluely works with other software.

## Features

- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Editing**: Use natural language to control DaVinci Resolve
- üñ•Ô∏è **Floating Overlay**: Always-on-top chat interface that stays out of your way
- üîß **System Tray Integration**: Runs in the background with quick access
- ‚å®Ô∏è **Global Shortcuts**: Toggle overlay with Ctrl+Shift+C (customizable)
- üõ°Ô∏è **Safe Execution**: Code safety checks before executing commands
- üìö **Command Database**: Local SQLite database with DaVinci commands
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Customizable Settings**: Configure OpenAI API, auto-execute, and more
